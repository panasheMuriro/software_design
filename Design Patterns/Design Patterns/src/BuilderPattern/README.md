# The Builder Pattern with a Silly Mini Project (Java)

Objective:
- Learn the Builder Pattern by creating a "Robot Sandwich Maker" that assembles custom sandwiches with bizarre ingredients.

## What is the Builder Pattern?
- The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## When to Use:
- When creating an object involves multiple steps or configurations.
- When the construction process should allow for more control over object composition.

## Mini Project: Robot Sandwich Maker

Scenario:
Youâ€™re building a Robot Sandwich Maker that allows customers (humans and aliens alike) to customize their sandwiches. Customers can add strange ingredients like "spicy meteor sauce" or "crunchy moon dust."
