# The Factory Pattern with a Silly Mini Project (Java)
Objective:
- Understand and implement the Factory Pattern by creating an "Alien Pizza Maker" that produces pizzas customized to the tastes of different alien species.

## What is the Factory Pattern?
The Factory Pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It allows the decision-making logic to reside in one place.

When to Use:

When a class needs to delegate the creation of objects.
When the exact type of object isn’t known until runtime.

## Mini Project: Alien Pizza Maker
Scenario:
Aliens across the galaxy have very specific pizza preferences. Earth’s pizzerias are struggling to keep up, so you’re tasked with building an Alien Pizza Maker Factory. Each alien species orders pizza based on their unique taste buds!
