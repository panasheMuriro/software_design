# The Prototype Pattern with a Practical Mini Project (Java)
## Objective:
Understand the Prototype Pattern by creating a practical project: "Cloning Geometric Shapes!"

### What is the Prototype Pattern?
   The Prototype Pattern involves creating new objects by copying (or cloning) an existing object, known as the prototype. This approach is beneficial when:

   - Object creation is costly or time-consuming.
   - You want to avoid reinitializing and setting up the same data multiple times.
   - You need copies of objects that may include deep or shallow cloning of complex structures.

## Mini Project: Cloning Geometric Shapes
   Scenario:
   We’re creating a design tool where users can duplicate shapes (like rectangles and circles) with specific properties such as dimensions and colors. Instead of creating new objects from scratch, we’ll clone existing shapes.
