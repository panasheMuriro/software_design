# Mini Project: Talking Parrot Simulator

Scenario: You are creating a parrot simulator where parrots repeat what you say but add their own quirky twist. 
We'll use the Strategy Pattern to allow the parrot to "change its speaking style" dynamically.

## Strategy Pattern Overview 

The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms (behaviors), encapsulate them, and make them interchangeable at runtime.

### Key Components:

- Context: The main object using the strategy (our Parrot).
- Strategy Interface: Defines a common behavior.
- Concrete Strategies: Implement variations of the behavior.
