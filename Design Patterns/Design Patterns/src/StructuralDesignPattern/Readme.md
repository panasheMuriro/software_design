# Structural Design Patterns

In this lesson, weâ€™ll explore Structural Design Patterns, which focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient. We will discuss the key patterns in this category and demonstrate how each can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## What are Structural Design Patterns?
Structural design patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects. They focus on how to structure and organize relationships between objects to provide more efficient and flexible solutions. These patterns help in reducing complexity and ensuring that objects work well together.

## Common Structural Design Patterns
We will look at the following patterns:

- Adapter (Wrapper) Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
