# What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. They help:

- Make code reusable and maintainable.
- Solve common coding challenges efficiently.
- Improve collaboration between developers.

Design patterns are categorized into three types:

1. Creational Patterns – Deal with object creation.
2. Structural Patterns – Focus on class and object composition.
3. Behavioral Patterns – Concerned with interaction between objects.
