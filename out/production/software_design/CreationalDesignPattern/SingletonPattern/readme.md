# The Singleton Pattern with a Silly Mini Project (Java)

Objective:
Learn how to implement the Singleton Pattern by creating a "Global DJ Soundboard" that ensures only one soundboard instance exists throughout the application.

## What is the Singleton Pattern?
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### When to Use:

When exactly one instance of a class is needed.
To manage shared resources like configuration files, logging services, or device controllers.

## Mini Project: Global DJ Soundboard

Scenario:
Youâ€™re creating a global soundboard for a DJ application. To prevent chaos, you want to ensure only one instance of the soundboard is used throughout the application. Each time someone tries to access the soundboard, they interact with the same instance.
